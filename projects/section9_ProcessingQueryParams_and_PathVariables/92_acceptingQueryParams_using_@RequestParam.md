> ``` http://localhost:8080/products?order=popular&filter=new```\

> This is not only applicable for the MVC application, the same applicable for whenever you are making rest API calls to the backend .
> So the same kind of pattern we can follow both in the backend and while forming the request on the UI side.\

>2. Accepting Query Params:\
>The next problem that I need to solve here is I need to catch those query params on the backend side.\
>So<mark>  in order to catch those query params we can use the annotation which is @RequestParam,</mark> the query params
that we are getting in the getURL() or we can also use it to accept the form data that we are going
to receive.\


>NOTE: One important configuration that I can do is, I can make this RequestParam as an mandatory or an optional.\
> ðŸ”¥so when I make <mark> required = false</mark> , My spring MVC or spring boot web application will not throw any error even in the getURL() path if that
particular query param is missing.\
ðŸ”¥ Whereas if I make <mark> required = true</mark> , then definitely it is a mandatory and if that query param or request
param is missing in the getURL(), then definitely your controller will throw an exception.\
> ðŸ”¥we can also mention name value, <mark> default value for the request param</mark> .\
> ðŸ”¥ If you use different method param names compared to what you are receiving inside the getURL().\
In that scenario, please make sure that you are using the <mark> name attribute</mark> .
> That way you are binding that given RequestParam to a particular method param name .\
> ðŸ”¥ we also have<mark> value attribute</mark>  that can be mentioned inside RequestParam annotation.\
So value attribute is very similar to name element itself where it can be used to define some alias
names.
