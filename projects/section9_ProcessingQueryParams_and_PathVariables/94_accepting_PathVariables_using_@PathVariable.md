 | If you look at this first two URLs they are looking like someone trying to query our database because they are giving conditions like I want order = popular and filter = new. | Directly mention what kind of products they want, So here there is no key and value, only value. the value inside my path can keep changing, so that's why we call as path variables or path params.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| So this is kind of querying our backend results based upon how they need inside URL itself.                                                                                    | So directly they will mention the what is the value and it will be like an agreement between the frontend and backend. Like what are the very first value that I'm getting that will be assumed to sort the results,Something like that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

I will catch that inside a variable. That's why I mentioned that variable inside the curly braces. The variable name that I kept here is display, the same variable name I need to catch inside the method input parameters with the help of @PathVariable. So you can see the display that I have mentioned inside the GetMapping the same name I'm using here. |

So these both annotations applies for MVC applications and rest based APIs as well.
