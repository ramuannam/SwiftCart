And inside these three methods I have set  different names for my vehicle like Audi, Honda and Ferrari.
With these bean declaration, my spring context will load all those beans during startup and you can see all these beans with the name vehicle one, vehicle two and vehicle three is being maintained by the spring IOC container

whatever method name that you have mentioned, the same name will be considered as a name of your spring bean.

As a next step, as a developer, what you are going to do is you are going to try to fetch the bean with the help of get bean method that we have discussed in the previous lecture.

And to this get bean method, you are passing the data type of the bean, which is vehicle.
>Now at this point of time, my spring has an ambiguity or confusion because there are three beans available inside the spring context with the same data type and the developer is not providing any details other than data type of the bean.
In these kind of scenarios, my spring IOC container will have a confusion and with that confusion it is going to 
throw an exception saying that no unique bean definition exception and you will get an exception called 
 "NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException".

The same may happen in autowiring and dependency injection as well.

So to avoid this getBean has multiple methods in it, so The method that I'm trying to invoke will accept two parameters.

1.Actual Name of the bean you referring.
2.datatype of the bean
