| Like if you can recall our discussion on the bean annotation, we have created more than one vehicle bean by just having multiple Java methods with the @bean annotation. |@component, you will only get one bean object of a specific class for your entire web application.|
* So based upon the scenario that you are into, you have to choose between these two annotations.

>* If you are into a scenario where you need to create multiple beans of a same data type, then definitely going 
   > with @bean is a correct decision.

a single bean for your entire web application is good enough.

| you can create a bean object of any data type class.It can be a class which is developed by you or it can be a class present inside a library like string etc,. | you can only create a bean for the classes that you have built on your own.         |
* For @Bean:  Like we created a bean of string class, a bean of integer class, which I have not written.
Those are available inside Java Library <mark> "because inside a Java method we can create the object by 
  ourself with the 
  help of new operator and that is giving a flexibility to us to create and convert any Java
object class into a bean, whether it is created by yourself or it is present inside a library".</mark>
* for @Component: The reason is you can't go and mention @component, annotation or any other stereotype annotation by going inside the libraries or dot class files available inside the third party jars.
As a developer, I can only add code inside my own project related Java classes.
* So due to that reason, with the help of @component, we can only create bean object instances for the application classes that are defined by yourself only.

|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Usually we need to write more code like seperate methods to create beans instances | Bean instances can be created with very less code like using @Component on top of the class.|
| Developer will have full control in creating and configuring the bean| Developer will not have any control in creating and configuring the bean.|

* The developer has full control because the developer himself is creating an object inside a Java method.
So once he create an object, he can initialize variables inside it.
That's why we are able to see some vehicle names when we use @bean. (example 3)
 

* but not when we are using @component because inside @component, developer not have any control.
It is a spring framework that creates a bean during the startup of the application.

| Inside @bean,<mark> spring framework creates a bean based upon the instructions provided by developer or values provided by the developer inside a Java method.</mark> | Whereas inside @component, it is a spring framework that takes full charge of creating a bean for a particular Java class.|

So both of them has their own pros and cons.

But I do see majority of the developers they use @component because the scenarios where you want to create an object 
by your.  Self and initialize the parameters is very rare.
That's why majority of the time developers simply create a Java class and on top of that they will put some stereotype annotation like @component, @service or @repository,
