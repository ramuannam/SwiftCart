*  the usage of @PreDestoy is very rare because most of the times spring framework itself
take care of closing all the database connections resources.
But if you have any rare scenario which spring framework is not handled, then definitely using
@PreDestroy you can write your own business logic like you can see on the left hand side inside the vehicle Java
class where we are trying to create a bean with the help of @Component, we can create a method
and on top of that method we can use @PreDestroy annotation.


>Once you did this configurations, <mark> whatever logic or whatever code that you write inside, this
destroy method will be executed by the spring framework or spring IOC container just before destroying
the vehicle bean inside spring context.</mark>

>So close is a method available under context which will close all the application context.
Destroys all the beans present inside the bean factory of spring IOC container.

 >>So close() method will initiate the closing and destroying of all the beans programmatically present in ioc container.
 Also that way we are making sure all the cleaning that we want to do, like database connections or
any resources that are still open, can be closed, which is a best practice inside web applications.

 >>where @PreDestroy  we can execute any logic that we want just before destroying that  bean.
you can see output in example also.
