As you can see, what user can see on your web application is only UI, UX, your business logic and responsive or your web application, whereas there are many other supporting components that will play
behind the scene to make your application work properly.

But as a developer, if I start focusing on building all the supporting components, it will take years and years to build a small web application.

So to avoid such scenarios, we have frameworks where they will provide all the supporting components like you want to implement caching or security or DB persistence logging.
The scenario can be anything.
You can leverage these frameworks and they will provide all the common supporting components to the developers.

And it's a duty of the developer to understand that framework and to configure that framework inside your web application.
That way you can strictly focus on business logic, which is very specific to your web application.

>So why I'm explaining this example is your web application development also is like pizza preparation.\
So if pizza preparation is your business logic supporting components like logging database persistence.\
So all those are the raw material ingredients that will be provided by framework.

But instead, if you choose not to follow any framework and start building all those by yourself, definitely
you will be into the scenario like Chef Sanjeev(in first comparison) here.
