**_Advantages of "Inversion of control" and " Dependency injection"_**

🔥1. loose coupling between the components:

Like we saw in the previous example that we discussed, how a vehicle manufacturer loose coupled from his dependencies like music system vendor or tyres vendor in a similar way, the ✍️components are the classes ✍️that you build inside your application they will not be any tight coupling and you will get loose coupling.

And the advantage of loose coupling is definitely you don't have to change your code whenever your dependencies changed inside your program.

🔥2.minimize the amount of code inside your application:

As a developer, I am free from objects creation and I don't have to create the same object in many places wherever I need.
I just need to provide the dependencies.That way I can use the same object instead of creating each and every time.

Suppose inside my class I have ten different methods, and inside these methods I need a Java object of a certain class.
I don't have to create the object of that class again and again.
I'll just autowire them to my class and spring will make sure those objects are available during the runtime when these methods are getting executed.
So that way we don't have to unnecessarily define the objects creation inside your code at many places, which will reduce the amount of code inside your application.

🔥3. MAKES UNIT TESTING EASY WITH DIFFERENT MOCKS that we can leverage during the unit testing.:

Since all your components are loosely coupled like in our vehicle scenario, my vehicle manufacturer doesn't know who is providing the music system.
Is it Sony or is it Bose? My vehicle manufacturer never knows.
He just care about there is some music system is getting injected at runtime, which the vehicle manufacturer can leverage to manufacture his vehicle.

Suppose in the scenarios where the music system vendor is not at ready with his music system. And still I want to test my vehicle manufacturing with other components.
Definitely, I can inject a mock object of music system which will act as a mock object.
That way you can continue with your unit testing and your unit testing also will become super easy since all your components are loosely coupled.

🔥4.Increased System maintainability and module reusability.

because the object creation will happen only at one time inside spring context, and the same object will be used in all the places inside your project.
And since your components are loosely coupled at any point of time, if you want to change your requirements or dependencies, you are free to do that.
That way your system maintainability also will be increased.

🔥5. Allows Concurrent or Independent development.

since we have loose coupling between our components, the development of these components can happen parallelly like I can complete my vehicle manufacturing coding with an assumption that my spring will take care of and inject the music system at runtime.
And if the music system business logic is not at ready, I can inject some mock objects using spring unit testing framework.
That way I can continue my development on the vehicle manufacturer.

Similarly, my music system business logic also can be developed parallelly and they don't have to wait for each other because everything is loosely coupled.
There won't be any compilation errors and if you still there is a need, we can use the mock objects that are available with the help of spring framework.

🔥6.Replacing the modules has no side effect on other modules.

like in the example scenario, if I decided to replace the Sony music system with the Bose music system, there will be zero impact on my vehicle manufacturing.
My vehicle manufacturing is not aware who is the vendor that is providing the music system.
That's why I don't even have to change a single line of code inside my vehicle manufacturing class.

With all these advantages of IOC and dependency injection, spring makes developers life easy and web applications development, especially inside enterprise applications very simple and maintainable over a period of time.

If you really ask me, give me one real life example of loose coupling scenario.
