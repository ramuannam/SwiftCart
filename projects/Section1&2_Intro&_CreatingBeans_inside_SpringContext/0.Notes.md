A Spring bean is an object managed by the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container. These beans form the backbone of a Spring application and are created, assembled, and managed by the container.
Beans are defined using configuration metadata, which can be provided in various ways such as XML-based configuration files, Java annotations like @Component, or Java classes annotated with @Configuration. The Spring container uses this configuration metadata to know how to create the bean, its lifecycle details, and its dependencies. Beans play a crucial role in the Spring framework, enabling the implementation of Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection principles.

Java Beans vs Spring Beans:
Java Beans:\
* Definition: Java Beans are simple Java classes that encapsulate objects and follow specific conventions like having 
  a no-argument constructor, private properties with public getter and setter methods, and implementing the Serializable interface.
* Usage: Java Beans are used for persistent and data transfer purposes.
* Creation: Java Beans are created using the new keyword like any other Java object.
Spring Beans:\
* Definition: Spring Beans are managed by the Spring Framework and are used for dependency injection and lifecycle management.
* Characteristics: Spring Beans are objects instantiated, assembled, and managed by the Spring IoC container.
* Creation: Spring Beans can be created and configured using XML configuration, Java annotations like @Component, or Java-based configuration.
* In summary, Java Beans are simple Java classes that encapsulate objects, while Spring Beans are managed by the Spring Framework, used for dependency injection, and lifecycle management within Spring-based applications.

when does bean creation happens in java,Spring beans?\
Java Beans:
Java Beans are created using the new keyword, just like any other Java object.
However, the use of new to create Java Beans is not recommended, as it prevents the use of dependency injection 
   and other advanced features provided by frameworks like Spring.
<br>
Spring Beans:
* In the Spring framework, beans are created by the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container.
* There are several ways to create Spring beans:
* 1.Declaring them in an XML configuration file(pom.xml), which the Spring container reads and instantiates at startup.1
* 2.Using the @Component annotation to mark a class as a bean, which the Spring container will auto-discover and instantiate.1
* 3.Defining bean creation logic in a @Configuration class, which the Spring container will execute to create the beans.13
* The Spring container is responsible for managing the lifecycle of these beans, including their creation, dependency injection, and destruction.
<br>
Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs):
* EJBs are created and managed by the EJB container, which is part of a Java EE application server.
* The EJB container is responsible for creating, managing, and executing the enterprise beans based on the deployment descriptors and annotations provided in the EJB code.5
In summary, the creation of Java Beans happens when the new keyword is used to instantiate them, while the creation of Spring Beans and Enterprise JavaBeans is handled by their respective IoC and EJB containers, which manage the bean lifecycle based on the configuration and annotations provided.

Constructor arguments refer to the parameters passed to a constructor when creating an object. These arguments are used to initialize the object's data members or properties

1.Java Beans:
Java Beans are lightweight, reusable software components typically used for building GUIs and other reusable parts.
They follow a simple set of conventions, including having properties with corresponding getter and setter methods.
2.IoC (Inversion of Control) Container:
The IoC container is a framework that manages the instantiation, configuration, and assembly of beans in a Spring application.
It implements the Inversion of Control (IoC) principle, also known as dependency injection (DI).
The IoC container is responsible for injecting the dependencies into the beans when it creates them.
The main IoC container interfaces in Spring are BeanFactory and ApplicationContext, with ApplicationContext being a more feature-rich superset of BeanFactory.
3.Dependency Injection (DI):
Dependency injection is a specialized form of IoC, where objects define their dependencies (the other objects they work with) through constructor arguments, factory method arguments, or properties.
The IoC container then injects these dependencies when it creates the bean.
This process is the inverse of the bean itself controlling the instantiation or location of its dependencies, hence the name "Inversion of Control".
Dependency injection promotes loose coupling, as the bean does not need to know the location or implementation of its dependencies.
In summary, Java Beans are the reusable software components, the IoC container is the framework that manages the creation and wiring of these beans, and dependency injection is the technique used by the IoC container to inject the dependencies into the beans, implementing the Inversion of Control principle.

different styles of configurations in spring?
1.XML-based Configuration:
This was the original configuration style in Spring, introduced in Spring 1.0 in 2004.
Beans are defined in XML configuration files, which specify the classes, properties, and dependencies.
The Spring container loads the XML definitions and manages the bean lifecycle.
Example: <bean id="loyaltyService" class="com.mybook.loyalty.service.impl.LoyaltyServiceImpl"> 1
2.Annotation-based Configuration:
Introduced in Spring 2.5 in 2007, this style uses Java annotations to define and configure beans.
Annotations like @Component, @Service, @Repository are used to mark classes as Spring beans.
The Spring container auto-detects and manages these annotated beans.
Dependency injection is achieved through annotations like @Autowired. 23
3.Java-based Configuration:
Introduced in Spring 3.0 in 2009, this style uses Java classes annotated with @Configuration to define bean definitions.
Methods in these @Configuration classes are annotated with @Bean to define the creation of Spring beans.
This provides a more programmatic and type-safe way to configure the application context. 34
4.Combination of Styles:
Spring allows mixing and matching the different configuration styles.
XML-based configuration can be combined with Java-based configuration using the @ImportResource annotation.
Java-based configuration can also import XML-defined beans using the @ImportXml annotation. 4
In summary, Spring provides three main configuration styles - XML-based, annotation-based, and Java-based - with the ability to combine them as needed for the application requirements
