i,e,.so when you try to get the bean only with the 'TYPE', and if there are multiple same types of bean, then spring 
ioc 
throws an exception(we solved this issue by "giving name of method"(which is same as bean name in ioc) of the specific 
bean as first 
parameter at getbean),
but when 
you don't specify that first parameter and also to avoid the exception then we use @primary annotation on one of the 
methods as "default" method, so it throws this default method instead of exception.
